# Portfolio Part 4: Abstract Class

## Assignment Overview

Now that you've had a chance to refine your designs a bit, it's time to start
writing some code. In this assignment, you will be making your first abstract
class. The abstract class will take on the name `ComponentSecondary`, where
`Component` is the name of your component. For example, if you're making a
Point3D component, the abstract class would be called `Point3DSecondary` as
follows:

```java
public abstract class Point3DSecondary implements Point3D {
   ...
}
```

Inside the abstract class, you will implement every secondary method you
specified in the enhanced interface. Because the secondary abstract class is
layered over the kernel interface, you cannot implement the methods of your
enhanced interface using the underlying representation. As a result, these
methods must be implemented using the kernel methods only.

Surprisingly, you have done this several times before without probably realizing
it. For example, when you first learned recursion in software 1, [you were
tasked with implementing the secondary methods of NaturalNumber][lab-14]. At the
time, they were static methods, but you were tasked with only implementing the
secondary methods using the kernel methods.

You did this a few other times as well. For example, we asked you to
[implement the secondary methods for set at one point][lab-21]. We did this by
having you extend `Set1L`, so you could override the implementation of
`remove()` and `add()`. At the time, we didn't force you to only use kernel
methods, but the premise remains the same. Meanwhile, in a later lab, you were
tasked with implementing the secondary method `sort()` of `Queue`.

Once you have implemented all of the secondary methods, you must also implement
the key `Object` methods. It's up to you to decide which ones you want to
implement, but `toString()` and `equals()` are a great start. You may also
implement `hashCode()` if you so choose. Note that these methods do not have
access to the representation, so you must also implement them using the kernel
methods only.

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Generate a list of changes since the previous iteration of a project
2. Use the kernel and Standard methods to implement a series of secondary
   methods that compile
3. Identify method preconditions and check them appropriately (i.e., follow
   design-by-contract)

## Assignment Rubric

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

1. (3 points) In keeping with the concept of iteration, the assignment must
   detail all of the changes from most recent submission (i.e., since the
   interfaces). Make sure to explain what was changed and why.
2. (4 points) The abstract class implementation must implement all methods
   from the enhanced interface (i.e., all secondary methods), and these methods
   must be implemented using only the kernel and Standard methods. In addition,
   the abstract class must implement `toString()` and `equals()`, but you may
   implement `hashCode()` as well. In general, the methods do not have to be
   100% correct, but their logic must make sense (i.e., no low effort
   implementations).
3. (3 points) When implementing the secondary methods, you must respect the
   contracts of the kernel methods. In other words, if a kernel method has a
   precondition, the client of the kernel method must check the precondition.
   If there is no method available to check the precondition, it must be added
   to the kernel.

## Pre-Assignment Tasks

> Before you write any code, I would recommend that you sit down and try to map
> out how you would implement your secondary methods given the constraint of
> only using kernel methods. Is it possible?
>
> Most likely, you are going to hit a bumb in the road in your design where the
> kernel methods aren't quite enough to get you an implementation of a secondary
> method. In that case, it is okay to update your design. All that I ask is that
> you document your changes and why in this section. Here's what that might look
> like:
>
> - Added a kernel method for `size()` because I am unable to check the
>   precondition of `remove()` without it.
> - Changed `getSignals()` method to `removeSignal()` method to eliminate
>   aliasing in my design.
>
> Feel free to use the template above when writing out your changes.

1. After reviewing the feedback on component interfaces, I moved the getter methods to kernel interface.

2. Added a kernel method `numberOfInputs()`: This method is needed to check the precondition of the `updateWeights()` secondary method, which requires the input array length to match the number of inputs the neuron expects.

3. Modified `activate(double[] inputs)` to return void: Since the activation function is now separated into its own secondary method (applyActivationFunction), the activate method only needs to perform the weighted sum and bias calculation. The result of this calculation will be stored internally and used by the applyActivationFunction method.

## Assignment Tasks

Your primary task for this assignment is to create an abstract class that falls
from the interfaces you previously designed. Because it is unlikely you have
done this before, consider browsing some examples in the API. Unfortunately,
there are not many. However, you might browse
[SimpleWriterSecondary][simple-writer-secondary] or
[SimpleReaderSecondary][simple-reader-secondary].

As with the previous assignment, you will share no code here. Instead, create
your abstract class file in `src`, and follow the submission instructions below.

## Post-Assignment Tasks

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that you
convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting.

In addition, the Java file you created should be submitted separately as a PDF.
This template includes the print to PDF extension, so you should be able to
click the print icon in the top right of this panel. In any case, do not copy
the Java code into this file.
